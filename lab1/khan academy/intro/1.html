    <h2> Preface </h2>
    <p>
    

<br> I'd never given much thought to how
<br>I would die -- though I'd had reason enough in
the last few months -- but even if I had,
<br>I would not have imagined it like this.
<br>I stared without breathing across the long room, into the dark eyes of the hunter, and he
looked pleasantly back at me.
<br>Surely it was a good way to die, in the place of someone else, someone
<br>I loved.
<br>Noble,even.
<br>That ought to count for something.
<br>I knew that if I'd never gone to Forks, I wouldn't be facing death now.
<br>But, terrified as I
was, I couldn't bring myself to regret the decision.
<br>When life offers you a dream so far
beyond any of your expectations, it's not reasonable to grieve when it comes to an end.
<br>The hunter smiled in a friendly way as he sauntered forward to kill me.
